# 3D-printer-G-code
This is a repository to share my custom g-code for the 3d printers that I use


I have tried to provide comments to explain what the code does, including commenting the original
code provided with the slicer. Some of that was gained through experimentation and may not be
correct.


P1P fast start is the start gcode that I use all the time.


Note: I will try to get around to adding other files as soon as I can.
